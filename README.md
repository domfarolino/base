# `//base` ðŸ§±

![ci-shield](https://github.com/domfarolino/base/actions/workflows/workflow.yml/badge.svg)

Base is a cross-platform threading and task scheduling library written in C++.
It provides a lightweight event loop implementation to support asynchronous
programming patterns, and the ability to perform platform-independent I/O.

It was designed based on pieces of Chromium's [`//base`] directory, which is a
collection of threading, task scheduling, synchronization, process management,
platform-independent I/O primitives, and much more.

This library was originally written in the [domfarolino/browser] repository, and
later pulled out into this repository to be a more general dependency for other
projects.
